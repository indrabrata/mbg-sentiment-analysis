## Model

The sentiment analysis model is built using a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of text samples with corresponding sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral). The model use pretrained transformer models for feature extraction and fine-tunes them for sentiment classification indobert-tweet.
